# VTEX Ads APP

This app allows you to display ads in VTEX stores in a simple and configurable way. It offers ready-to-use components to render banners, sponsored product carousels, and sponsored brand placements in strategic areas of your store.

While this app is designed to work smoothly with the VTEX Site Editor (CMS), the initial setup requires a developer. The ad blocks must first be declared in the store theme code before they become available in the Site Editor, where visual and behavioral configurations can then be adjusted as needed.

## Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup with VTEX CLI
- **Site Editor Compatible**: Visual configuration through VTEX CMS
- **Multiple Ad Types**: Banners, sponsored products, and sponsored brands
- **Event Tracking**: Built-in impression, click, and conversion tracking
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop optimized components
- **Native VTEX Components**: Uses VTEX's native product components for consistency

## How It Works

The VTEX Ads APP provides a complete solution for implementing retail media in VTEX stores:

1. **Installation**: Install the app via VTEX CLI and configure publisher settings
2. **Theme Integration**: Declare ad blocks in your store theme
3. **Configuration**: Set up ad placements and targeting through the admin panel
4. **Display**: Ads are automatically rendered based on page context and configuration
5. **Tracking**: Events are automatically tracked and sent to the ad platform

This approach ensures seamless integration with your existing store theme while providing powerful advertising capabilities.
